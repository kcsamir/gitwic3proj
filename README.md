# gitwic3proj
Baseline SSP2 assumptions + projection. Make your own scenario and project.

Prepared code for SSP2 projection (five R files)
1. set scenario details
2. set statespace
3. fill statespace
4. projection
5. results (graphs/tables)


Setup Folders  and copy files
1. Create a working folder (any name; let us call it 'wic3proj'). We will later created multiple sub-folders
2. Create a subfolder called "gitwic3proj" inside the 'wic3proj'  (wic3proj\gitwic3proj). 
3. Create an R project named "gitwic3proj" in the folder "gitwic3proj"
4. We will now download the files from the github account https://github.com/kcsamir/gitwic3proj and save them in the folder "gitwic3proj"
5. Open "Main WIC.r" and start running the code

R-Studio session .....   
The following folders are created within the code   
1. We will later update the files in this folder if needed
2. Create "input_wic3proj" and "output_wic3proj" folder in the "output" folder
3. "input_wic3proj" contains all the data files needed to run the first scenario - SSP2
4. "output_wic3proj" will contain an additional folder for each scenario (created within the code)
5. Next, save all the input files provided (via WeChat or email in the input_wic3proj folder)

Now, we will start the scenario (SSP2)
6. Open the first file "scen_w09_ssp2_emort_efert_emig.r". Let us go through this file.
